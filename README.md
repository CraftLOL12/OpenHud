# OpenHud - Open source CS2 Hud and Admin Panel
Start of an open source CS2 Custom Hud.
<br/>
EXTREMELY EARLY AND EXPERIMENTAL.
<br/>
- Styling: TailwindCSS / Material UI / Sass
- Tech: NodeJS, Express, React, Typescript, Axios, Socketio, SQLite3

# To Do:
- Teams API
- Matches API
- Dashboard API
- Fully integrate all APIs with HUD

# Getting Started:

  - Download this [GSI Config File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_GvudI1GroWY8hpBTcqbvNWcbOlf-iRS/view?usp=sharing) and place it in your `steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg`
  - Start the GSI server by running `node index.js` in the integrated terminal for the Server folder. This gets the server up and running listening for data from CS2.
  - Run `npm start` in the integrated terminal for the Client folder.

Hopefully it ends up looking very nice and lets a lot of people use it in their streams!
