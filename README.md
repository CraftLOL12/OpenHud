# Open Hud - Open source CS2 Hud and Admin Panel
Start of an open source CS2 Custom Hud.
<br/>
EXTREMELY EARLY AND EXPERIMENTAL.
<br/>
- Styling: TailwindCSS / Material UI / Sass
- Tech: NodeJS, Express, React, Typescript, Axios, Socketio

# To Do:
- Teams API
- Matches API
- Dashboard API
- Fully integrate all APIs with HUD

To start:

  Start the GSI server by running `node index.js` in the integrated terminal for the Server folder. This gets the server up and running listening for data from CS2.
  Run `npm start` in the integrated terminal for the Client folder.

Hopefully it ends up looking very nice and lets a lot of people use it in their streams!
